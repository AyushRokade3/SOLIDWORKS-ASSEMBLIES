# SOLIDWORKS-ASSEMBLIES
THIS ARE THE SOLIDWORKS ASSEMBLIES MADE BY ME 'AYUSH ROKADE' FOR PRACTICE.
This repository contains a collection of SolidWorks assembly files where all components are fully defined, constrained, and properly fitted. Each assembly demonstrates best practices in parametric modeling, mate definitions, and design intent preservation.
✅ Features
- Fully defined parts with no under-defined sketches
- Proper use of mates (coincident, concentric, distance, angle, etc.)
- Clean and organized feature tree
- No interference or misalignment between components
- Assemblies optimized for performance and clarity
How to Use
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open .SLDASM files in SolidWorks 2020 or later.
- Ensure all referenced .SLDPRT files are in the correct relative paths.
- Use the exploded views and motion studies for visualization and analysis.
📌 Notes
- All parts are fully constrained using standard mates.
- Assemblies are free from rebuild errors and warnings.
- Designed with manufacturing and simulation in mind.
